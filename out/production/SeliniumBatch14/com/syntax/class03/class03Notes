Locators:
-----------------------------------Absolute Xpath-------------------------------
Xpath :
 1.Absolute
 2.Relative


 Absolute Xpath:
                starts with starting node html and then you proceed in the hierarchy

                Absolute:
                1)Absolute xpath starts from root node.
                2)Absolute  xpath start with /
                3)in absolute xpath we use only tags/nodes

Example:
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My Web</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <button>Press ME</button>
 		<input> text</input>
        <div>
 			<input>box</input>
 		</div>
 		<div>
            <input>box</input>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>


Answer:
/html/body/div[2]/input


reasons not used often:
1.too long, complicated
2.If there is any addition web elements or removed any web elements  in the hirearchy, then  the path won't be valid any more



----------------------------------------------Relative Xpath----------------------------------------

Relative xpath:
in releative xpath, we don't have to naviage through hirearchy . it will directly moves to the desire path on DOM.
1)Relative xpath direclty jump to elements on DOM()
2)Relative xpath start with //
3)In Relative xpath we use attributes

Syntax for relative xpath:
1.-----Xpath to identify by attribute------
//tagname[@attribute='attribute value']

english :get me the 'tagname'  which has  an 'attribute' whose value is 'attribute value'


Example:

<input id="box",class="white">box</input>

xpath:
//input[@id='box']

english :get me the tag "input" which has an attribute "id" whose value is "box"


2.-----Xpath to identify by text------
//tagname[text() = 'text value']

english: get me the tagname which has text that is "text value"

example:
//a[text()='Forgotten password?']

english: get the tag a which has a text that is "forgotten password?"


3.----Xpath to identify by contains Method------

****for attributes****
//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]

english :
get me the tag name  which has the attribute and the attribute value contains "the partial value"

Example:
//button[contains(@type , 'sub')]

english : get me the tag button which has the attribute and the attribute value contains "sub"

use case:
1.long attribute value
2. some part is dynamic of the attribute value   id="textBoxhighlighted125" we can simply skip the part that is dynamic


****for text****
//tagname[contains(text(), 'partial text value')]

example:
//a[contains(text(),'Forgot')]

english:get me the tag button which has the text and the text  value contains "Forgot"

4.-----Xpath to identify by starts with------

Syntax:
//tagname[starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting attribute value')]

example:
//input[starts-with(@name,'pa')]

difference between contain and start

contain --->text contains anywhere
starts --->at the begnning.

css(Cascading stylish sheet) selector combination
Note: Tag is optional.
in css selector can accept  multiple combination to find the web elements.
it's basically customized locator.

1)Tag and ID (or) we can use just ID ,like #id
note: Tag is optional  and for id we always want to put #. # --> represent the ID

2)Tag and class (or) we can use just class, like .class
note:Tag is optional  and for class we always want to put "dot". .--> represent the Class

3)Tag , class and attribute (or) we can use just attribute , like [attribute=value]
Tag, class, & attribute.
note : sometime we  will see tag and class will carry same webelements , so in that senario we can have this combination .
for more details: check "Practice" Package in CSSDemo class
===========================================

xpath is defined as XML Path.

type of xpath?
1)Absolute xpath/full path --> start from the root, we have navigate each node, we won't use attribute
/html/body/div[1]/div/div[3]/div[1]/img
2)Relative xpath/partial xpath
//*[@id="divlogo"]/img.

Diff between Absolute & relative xpath
Absolute:

1)Relative xpath direclty jump to elements on DOM()
2)Relative xpath start with //
3)In Relative xpath we use attributes

syntax  of Relative  xpath:

//*[@attribute='value']

2)chropath extension
3)selectorsHub

what does  navigate() and get() do.
both will open the webpage, based on the url passed on the parameter. but

what is the disadvantage of using  navigate() ?

The navigate is not going wait for the web application or web page to loaded fully,
where as get() will wait for the  whole application to open up/load up fully.
